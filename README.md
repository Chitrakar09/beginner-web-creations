# Projects Repository  

This repository showcases foundational web development projects I’ve created, demonstrating my growth and skills as a developer. It includes a variety of projects that reflect my learning journey, problem-solving ability, and creativity in web development.  

## About  

The **beginner-web-creations** repository serves as a portfolio for the basic web development projects I’ve worked on. It provides a comprehensive look at the essential challenges I’ve tackled and the solutions I’ve built over time. From simple prototypes and interactive websites to frontend and backend experiments, this repository highlights my commitment to learning and improving the fundamentals.  

In parallel, I am working on more complex and advanced projects in a separate repository, where I explore more sophisticated web applications and developer tools.  

## Contents  

The projects in this repository focus on the core fundamentals of web development, specifically:

- **Web Development**: Simple, interactive websites built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Personal Projects**: Basic tools and ideas created to practice and showcase fundamental web development skills.
- **Learning Projects**: Small experiments and prototypes to explore different concepts and techniques in web development.

## How to Explore  

Each project is organized into its own directory for easy navigation. To get started:  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/Chitrakar09/beginner-web-creations.git

### 3. Rock-Paper-Scissors (Basic Implementation)
A simple implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While it lacks an AI opponent and fully interactive UI elements, it showcases:
- Basic game logic using JavaScript.
- User interface structure with clickable elements.
- A starting point for further enhancements like AI opponents and improved animations.
  

## Future Plans

This repository focuses on the basics of web development, and I am currently working on more complex and advanced projects in a separate repository. My upcoming work will include:
- Developing advanced web applications.
- Creating tools and utilities for developers.
